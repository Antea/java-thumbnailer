# Enhance Feature

v0.4
----
(not published yet)

+ Add Apache POI 3.7
+ Old Office Files are now detected via MIME

Failing Tests:
- ChainedHashtable: testBacking                 (not important, as currently not used)
- ThumbnailersFailingTest: testFailingJOD       (JOD may falsely claim having succeeded when converting a binary file)
- MIMEDectectionExtensiveTest: txt-related (10) (Txt files cannot be detected by content - should we detect ASCII-Files?)

v0.3
----
(9. August 2011)

* Make Lucene Value "filelocation" relative to thumnailFolder
* Changed Lucene Value "no thumbnailer found" to "nothumbnailerfound" (to avoid tokenizing)
* Add <thumbnailer:img/> to taglib

v0.2
----
(2. August 2011)

+ MIME-Test: Office2007-Files & OpenOffice files are detected via Zip/XML
# Upgrade PDFBox 1.5.0 -> 1.6.0
* JODConverter didn't delete his temporary files if conversion failed

Failing tests:
- ChainedHashtable: testBacking              (not important, as currently not used)
- MimeDetectionTest: testOfficeFiles{1,2,3}  (meaning only that conversion takes longer than necessary) 
- ThumbnailersFailingTest: testFailingJOD    (JOD may falsely claim having succeeded when converting a binary file)

v0.1
----
(29. July 2011)

First public release.
